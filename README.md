# 🚀 #100DaysOfSOC 

Welcome to my **100 Days of SOC & Cybersecurity Journey**.  
The goal: Become a **modern, 10x hireable cybersecurity analyst** in 2025 — SOC, EDR, MDR/XDR, Cloud, Threat Intel, and GRC awareness.

---

## 📅 Plan Overview
- **Days 1–30** → Core Foundations (Networking, OS, Bash, PowerShell, Python, CLI)  
- **Days 31–60** → SOC Skills (SIEM, alert investigations, detection rules)  
- **Days 61–80** → EDR, MDR, XDR & Detection Engineering  
- **Days 81–100** → Modern Security (Cloud, Containers, Zero Trust, AI/ML in Security, GRC)  

---

## 🎯 Outcome
- 40+ **Mini Projects** (SOC, EDR, SIEM, Threat Intel, Cloud, AI/ML)  
- Practical **alert investigation reports** & GitHub portfolio  
- Ability to **write detection rules** (Sigma, KQL, SPL)  
- Cloud & container security basics + Zero Trust fundamentals  
- Awareness of GRC & compliance frameworks (NIST, ISO, SOC2) 
---  

**Core Tools & Domains**  
- SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, ELK)  
- EDR/XDR (Defender ATP, CrowdStrike, Velociraptor)  
- Cloud Security (AWS, Azure basics, IAM, WAF)  
- Threat Intel & Hunting (MITRE ATT&CK, IOC enrichment, hunting queries)  
- GRC Awareness (NIST CSF, ISO 27001, SOC2, GDPR)  
- AI/ML in Security (LLMs for detection & analysis)
